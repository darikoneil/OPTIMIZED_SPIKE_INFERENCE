# OPTIMIZED_SPIKE_INFERENCE
SCRIPTS FOR OPTIMIZED SPIKE INFERENCE IMPLEMENTING JEWELL METHOD OF L0-OPTIMIZATION

## Optimal lambda is defined as that which minimizes the number of ("false") spikes that do not exceed twice the stdev of the intrinsic noise of an adjusted DFoF
Given that eventually lambda will (likely) progress to such a level that no spike events are detected, this script selects the first lambda to minimize the number of false spikes.
That is, the optimal lambda is that which detects the most spikes while minimizing the number of false spike detections.

## Constrained or different autoregressive orders can be inserted simply by adding correct tag in single_loop & final_fit functions

## Gamma decay can be solved for directly by measuring the decay of single AP in a particular genetic line.
Solving the approximate gamma = 1-(Delta/Phi) has shown sufficiency
where Delta = 1/framerate &
Phi is an approximate indicator-specific value 
(i.e., 0.7, 1.2 or 2 for fast, medium, or slow GCaMP6 respectively)

## The size of the median filter can be adjusted in the set order function
It currently is set to approximately 3 seconds to adjust for long-scale shifts in fluorescence
Good chance you do some sort of filtering on your trace anyway, so make sure to comment this out if so
Much prefer a gaussian filter of width of approx. one-half the rise+decay time of your indicator
